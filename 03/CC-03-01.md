###Coding Challenge - Week 3 #01

* Create a function called `capitalize` that will capitalize any word passed into it.
* Create a function called `looper` that will loop over an array that's passed in and capitalize each of the items in the array and log it to the console.
* Create a function called `adder` that will add two numbers together and `return` the result
* Prompt the user for 5 names (all lowercase).
* Add each name to an array
* Call the `looper` function passing to it the array.  Do all names get capitalized and logged to the console?
* Prompt the user for two numbers
* Call the `adder` function, passing to it both numbers.  EX: `console.log(adder(num1, num2));`
* Log to the console all names in the array on one line, delimited by `~~~` (remember our `join('~~~~')` function?)
