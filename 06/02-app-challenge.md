###Build An App

**Stakeholders**:

**Synopsis**

I want to build a video game catalog application.  It should be able to:

* Add video games to a list of video games
    * Should collect title and genre of the video game
    * Should be able to add a link to an image on the page
* Remove the video game from the list of games using a button
* Every game should have a button called "Info" that should alert the title and genre of a game.
* All code should be checked into a github repo.
* I would like to see design mockups before we begin building the app.
